# NeuroEvolution
Certainly! Here's a short README summary for your neuro-evolution project:


Welcome to our neuro-evolution project! This project is a raw implementation that explores the power of neural networks through evolutionary algorithms. We utilize both mutation algorithms and a mix of asexual and sexual crossover mutations to enhance our network over time.

## Features:

1. **Mutation Algorithm**: Dynamically alters the network's weights to find optimal solutions.
2. **Asexual Crossover Mutation**: A single parent contributes to the offspring's genetic makeup.
3. **Sexual Crossover Mutation**: Two parents contribute to the offspring's genetic makeup.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:

This program can run on C++11

### Running the Project:

After setting up the prerequisites, you can run the project by simply entering the following command:

```bash
make
./evolution

```

This will initiate the evolutionary process and you'll be able to see the neural network evolve over time.

## Comments
Right now there is a defualt test case, if you wnat to run your own test cases please contact me at liyulg0@gmail.com and we can arrange something, version 2 coming  out soon

## Acknowledgements:

Special thanks to **Eric Wu** for his invaluable assistance with the code. Your insights and expertise have been instrumental in bringing this project to life.
